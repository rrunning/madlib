	<p>Many say that brainstorming is   (Adjectives)   and does not   (Verb)  . However, with the combination of the right computer and   (noun)   anyone  can lead a good    (Verb)  . When you have    (adverb)   pulled together a   (Adjectives)      group of   (noun)   in a big room with lots of TV\s then  magical things will happen.

This has proved to be    (adverb)   problematic.  But in the end the most important   (noun)   usually is brought to light.  Typically we try to encourage ideas to    (Verb)  , and never shut ideas  down. This concludes our instructions. Thanks for    (adverb)   listening!</p>
