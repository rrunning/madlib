	<p>Every Christmas we  <span id="verb"></span> to a   <span id="adjective"></span>   tree farm far away. This is not just any   <span id="adjective"></span>   tree farm. My dad and I <span id="verb"></span> onto the   <span id="noun"></span>   to <span id="verb"></span> for the perfect   <span id="noun"></span>  .  Some people like them   <span id="adjective"></span>  , but I prefer them   <span id="adjective"></span>  . After  searching for hours I usually   <span id="adverb"></span>   exclaim "Dad! The perfect tree is over   there!" Off we <span id="verb"></span> to get the tree. The problem is we always forget the  <span id="noun"></span>   and the  <span id="noun"></span>  . But at the end of the day we    <span id="adverb"></span>   get the tree and head home    <span id="adverb"></span>  . "I wish it was Christmas all year round"  I    <span id="adverb"></span>   think to myself.</p>

	<p>Today I went shopping. When I arrived at the store I saw a   <span id="adjective"></span>     <span id="noun"></span>  , who upon noticing me    <span id="adverb"></span>   said "I need to <span id="verb"></span> ". "Well,   that was   <span id="adjective"></span>  " I thought to myself and walked in the store. The store had rearranged it\s inventory, so I felt    <span id="adverb"></span>   lost. I   walked up to store clerk and said    <span id="adverb"></span>   "I am looking for a   <span id="adjective"></span>     <span id="noun"></span>   that doesnâ€™t <span id="verb"></span> as often as the last one I had." The store clerk    looked at me with a   <span id="adjective"></span>   look in his eye and said, "What you are looking for can be found by the   <span id="noun"></span>  , if you see a   <span id="noun"></span>   that    <span id="adverb"></span>   can    <span id="verb"></span>  , then you've gone too far." As I tried to understand his directions, I thought to myself, "I should have just ordered it    on amazon.com, Their products seem to    <span id="verb"></span>   the perfect amount"</p>

	<p>Many say that brainstorming is   <span id="adjective"></span>   and does not   <span id="verb"></span>  . However, with the combination of the right computer and   <span id="noun"></span>   anyone  can lead a good    <span id="verb"></span>  . When you have    <span id="adverb"></span>   pulled together a   <span id="adjective"></span>      group of   <span id="noun"></span>   in a big room with lots of TV\s then  magical things will happen. In the past we have    <span id="adverb"></span>   suggested  participants work together to find the most   <span id="adjective"></span>   solution. The   most difficult part is many   <span id="adjective"></span>     <span id="noun"></span>   like to   <span id="verb"></span> . This has proved to be    <span id="adverb"></span>   problematic.  But in the end the most important   <span id="noun"></span>   usually is brought to light.  Typically we try to encourage ideas to    <span id="verb"></span>  , and never shut ideas  down. This concludes our instructions. Thanks for    <span id="adverb"></span>   listening!</p>
