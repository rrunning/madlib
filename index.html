			<p>Every Christmas we <span class="verb"></span> to a <span class="adjective"></span> tree farm far away. This is not just any <span class="adjective"></span> tree farm. My dad and I <span class="verb"></span> onto the <span class="noun"></span> to <span class="verb"></span> for the perfect <span class="noun"></span>. Some people like them <span class="adjective"></span>, but I prefer them <span class="adjective"></span>. After searching for hours I usually <span class="adverb"></span> exclaim "Dad! The perfect tree is over there!" Off we <span class="verb"></span> to get the tree. The problem is we always forget the <span class="noun"></span> and the <span class="noun"></span>. But at the end of the day we <span class="adverb"></span> get the tree and head home <span class="adverb"></span>. "I wish it was Christmas all year round" I <span class="adverb"></span> think to myself.</p>

			<p>Today I went shopping. When I arrived at the store I saw a <span class="adjective"></span> <span class="noun"></span>, who upon noticing me <span class="adverb"></span> said "I need to <span class="verb"></span>". "Well, that was <span class="adjective"></span>" I thought to myself and walked in the store. The store had rearranged it's inventory, so I felt <span class="adverb"></span> lost. I walked up to store clerk and said <span class="adverb"></span> "I am looking for a <span class="adjective"></span> <span class="noun"></span> that doesn't <span class="verb"></span> as often as the last one I had." The store clerk looked at me with a <span class="adjective"></span> look in his eye and said, "What you are looking for can be found by the <span class="noun"></span>, if you see a <span class="noun"></span> that <span class="adverb"></span> can <span class="verb"></span>, then you've gone too far." As I tried to understand his directions, I thought to myself, "I should have just ordered it on amazon.com, Their products seem to <span class="verb"></span> the perfect amount".</p>

			<p>Many say that brainstorming is <span class="adjective"></span> and does not <span class="verb"></span>. However, with the combination of the right computer and <span class="noun"></span> anyone can lead a good <span class="verb"></span>. When you have <span class="adverb"></span> pulled together a <span class="adjective"></span> group of <span class="noun"></span> in a big room with lots of TV's then magical things will happen. In the past we have <span class="adverb"></span> suggested participants work together to find the most <span class="adjective"></span> solution. The most difficult part is many <span class="adjective"></span> <span class="noun"></span> like to <span class="verb"></span>. This has proved to be <span class="adverb"></span> problematic. But in the end the most important <span class="noun"></span> usually is brought to light. Typically we try to encourage ideas to <span class="verb"></span>, and never shut ideas down. This concludes our instructions. Thanks for <span class="adverb"></span> listening!</p>
